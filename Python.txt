Python

	Binary Search
		split the data in half each time
		most efficient way of finding an item in an ordered list
		allows for very fast searching of the data
		
	Lists and Tuples
		Sequence is an ordered collection of items
			if it wasn't then we couldn't reference by index

		
		Iteratable
			anything we can iterate over
			object that contains either an __iter__ method
				or __getitem__ method
			indexing starts at zero
				not all iterables are sequences

		
		Common Sequence Operations
			append
			count
				.count("s")
			max
			min
			len
				how many items does this datastructure contain
		
		
		Enumerate
			returns each item with its indexed position
				ex:
				for index, character in enumerate("abcdefgh"):
					print(index, character)
		
		
		Sorting Things
			.sorted()
			sorting a list you will get a new list back
				Uppercase will be before lowercase
				Spaces will be included
				Letters will be doubled
			
			.sort()
			changes the list
			assigning it to a new variable and printing it will result in "none"
			
			## Python lets you rebind existing functions, so be careful with variable names
			
		Case-insensitive Sorting
			casefold
				missing_letter = sorted("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog",
							key=str.casefold)
				names.sort(key=str.casefold)
